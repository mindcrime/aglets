LOGGING REFACTORING:
I've introduced the class org.aglets.log.AgletsLogger that represents a generic logger to user aroung the code.
It substitutes the previous logcategory and logger (no more supported from log4j). I've added in the cnf directory the
configuration file for log4j, thus the logging can be driven by such file. I'm also changing all the code
around thus it can use such new logger.
